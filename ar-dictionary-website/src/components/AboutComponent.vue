            <h1>What Is AR Dictionary?</h1>
            <p class="about-p1">AR Dictionary is the answer to a question that sprung up in my mind as I was reading a book.
                As I was reading this book I kept coming across words that I did not understand, and as I kept reading the whole process
                of stopping what I was doing, opening Chrome on my phone and manually looking for the word on Google
                became more and more tedious, until I eventually stopped doing that and kept on reading.
                Then I asked myself the question:
            </p>
            <p class="about-quote">Isn't there a faster way to do this?</p>
            <p class="about-p2">To my surprise, there wasn't. So I decided to make it myself. AR Dictionary is an app that
                greatly speeds up the process of looking up a new word. All you have to do is point your phone
                at the page, tap on the word you would like to look up and a definition pops up within a second.
                The process of looking up a word no longer disrupts your activity and you can get back to whatever
                you were reading within seconds.
